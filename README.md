StockViz - Stock Data Analyzer

Hello! My name is Kenny Monterrosos, and I have developed StockViz, a stock data analyzer tool built using .NET Framework. The application parses stock data from CSV files and visualizes it using candlestick charts, allowing users to analyze stock patterns effectively.

Features
Windows Forms Application: Built with the .NET Framework, providing a user-friendly interface for visualizing stock data.
Data Parsing & Visualization: Reads stock data from CSV files and constructs a detailed candlestick chart for better market analysis.
Candlestick Pattern Recognition: Implements algorithms to detect 12 common candlestick patterns like Doji, Marubozu, Hammer, and more, revealing trends and insights.
Interactive Interface: Provides a clear, interactive view of stock data, helping users identify patterns and make informed decisions.

How can you run the project?
- clone the repository to your local machine
- open in Visual Studio (open the sln file)

What technologies did I use?
- .NET Framework: For building the Windows Forms application.
- C#: The primary programming language used.
- Windows Forms: For the UI and handling user interactions.
- CSV Parsing: Reading and processing stock data from CSV files.
